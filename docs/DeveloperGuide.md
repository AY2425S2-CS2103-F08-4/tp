## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel` etc. All
these UI components inherit from the abstract `UiPart<T>` class which captures the commonalities between classes that
represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The UI employs a flexible design pattern through several key components:

1. **Card System**: The UI uses a card-based display system:
    - The `Card<T>` interface defines how entity information is displayed
    - `XCard` classes (like EventCard) implement this interface and extend `UiPart<Region>`
    - The `CardFactory<T>` interface and its implementation `GenericCardFactory<T>` are responsible for creating
      appropriate cards for different entity types

2. **Display Adapters**:
    - The `DisplayableItem` interface in the util package defines how items can be displayed in the UI
    - The abstract `ItemAdapter<T>` class provides a foundation for adapting model entities to the UI
    - `GenericAdapter<T>` implements this pattern, allowing model items to be wrapped for display

3. **List Display**:
    - `ListPanel` uses `DisplayableListViewCell` (which extends `UiPart`) to render items
    - Each cell renders a `DisplayableItem` by calling its `getDisplayCard()` method
    - The `MainWindow` has two separate `ListPanel` instances for different types of content

The `UiManager` (which implements the `Ui` interface) is responsible for initializing all UI components and handling
JavaFX lifecycle events. It maintains a reference to the `Logic` component to execute commands and observe model
changes.

These relationships form a clear separation of concerns:

- `XCard` references model entity `X` directly to display its properties
- `DisplayableListViewCell` renders any `DisplayableItem` in a type-safe manner
- `Card` interface provides a consistent way to get the underlying `UiPart`
- `ItemAdapter` uses a `CardFactory` to create appropriate cards

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component to execute commands
* Listens for changes to `Model` data to update the UI accordingly
* Depends on classes in the `Model` component (through direct references and adapter patterns)
* Uses event handling for user interactions through click handlers assigned to list items
* Supports different view modes that can be toggled in the `MainWindow`
* Uses `GenericCardFactory` and `GenericAdapter` to handle model items in a type-safe way

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("contact delete 
1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`), should end at 
the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ParserImpl` object which in turn cascades 
   through the parser hierarchy (item -> operation) to find a parser that matches the command (e.g., 
   `DeleteContactCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g. 
   `DeleteContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ParserImpl` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
  placeholder for the specific command and item name e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`) which uses the other classes 
  shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the 
  `ParserImpl` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the 
  `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)


The `Model` component,

* stores the data, i.e., all `Contact`, `Todo`, and `Event` objects (which are contained in separate `UniqueItemList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The diagram below shows how the APIs of the `Model` component are exposed.

<puml src="diagrams/ModelInterfaces.puml" width="450" />

Storing `Contact`, `Todo`, and `Event` share many similarities, so we extract common methods into abstract classes. Yes, we know that we are geniuses at naming things.

<puml src="diagrams/ManagerClassDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

The diagram below shows how a `Contact` is managed by the `Model`.

<puml src="diagrams/ContactManagerClassesDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The diagram below shows how a `Todo` is managed by the `Model`. An `Event` is managed in a similar way.

<puml src="diagrams/TodoManagerClassesDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The diagram below shows different relationship between different `Item`s managed by the `Model`.

<puml src="diagrams/ItemClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both item data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from all of `ContactStorage`, `TodoStorage`, `EventStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`). Notably, `TodoStorage` and `EventStorage` depend on an `ItemNotInvolvingContactManager<Contact>` to validate contacts' IDs and get the corresponding `Contact`s.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
