# TutorConnect User Guide

TutorConnect is a **CLI-based student management tool designed for tutors handling multiple courses across different platforms.**
It provides a centralized solution for organizing student contacts and managing tasksâ€”without the complexity of a full-fledged learning management system.
If you can type fast, TutorConnect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorConnect.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands working with item will be of format `ITEM COMMAND PARAMETERS`.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add --name NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add --name John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `--name NAME [--tag TAG(S)]` can be used as `--name John Doe --tag friend`, `--name John Doe`, or `--name John Doe --tag enemy must-be-destroyed`.

* Parameters with optional plural markers can be specified a positive integer number of times.
  Note that this rule can be combined with the previous one to represent a parameter that can be specified a non-negative integer number of times.<br>
  e.g. `--contact CONTACT_INDEX/INDICES` can be used as `--contact 123` or `--contact 4 5 6`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `--name NAME --location LOCATION`, `--location LOCATION --name NAME ` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `todo list`, `exit` and `event clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `todo list 123`, it will be interpreted as `todo list`.

* Constraints for common parameters:
    * Most text-based parameters can accept multiple words as values, but the words cannot start with a `-` to avoid clashing with our prefixes. This applies to `NAME`, `ID`, `COURSE`, `GROUP`, and `LOCATION`.
      e.g. `NUS Science`, `E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial`, `#?!@-*#$` are acceptable, but `1 - 1 = 2` is not.
    * Datetime-based parameters must be of format `YY-MM-DD HH:MM`, with exactly one space between `DD` and `HH`, and where `HH` is in the 24-hour format.
    * `TAG` parameters must be a single word not starting with `-`.
    * Index-based parameters must be a positive integer not larger than the size of the list of interest.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Event: `event`

### Adding an event: `add`
Adds an event to the address book.

Format: `event add --name NAME --start START_DATETIME --end END_DATETIME --location LOCATION [--tag TAG(S)]`

**Important:** start time and end time format is `YY-MM-DD HH:MM`, where `HH` is in 24 hour format and start time must be earlier than end time.

**Tip:** An event can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:
* `event add --name CS2040S tutorial --start 24-08-26 12:00 --end 24-08-26 14:00 --location NUS SoC COM1 --tag algorithms`

### Editing an event: `edit`
Edits the details of the event identified by the index number in the currently displayed event list. Only the fields specified in the command will be updated; all others remain unchanged.

Format:
`event edit INDEX [--name NAME] [--start START_TIME] [--end END_TIME] [--location LOCATION] [--contact CONTACT_INDEX/INDICES] [--tag TAG(S)]`

* `INDEX` refers to the event to be edited, based on its position in the displayed event list.

* Fields that are not included in the command will remain unchanged. You can update any combination of fields at once. At least 1 field should be edited.

* If `--tag` is provided with no value, all tags will be cleared.

Important:

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer.

* `CONTACT_INDEX/INDICES` refers to the index(es) in the contact list currently displayed on the right.

Examples:

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
